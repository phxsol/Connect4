This is a response to a development test received during an interview process.

In order to install, npm will also need to be installed.

Once installed, and the repository has been fetched, run:

  npm install

...to pull the dependancies... then:

  npm start

...to run the server in debug mode.
The app will be found at localhost:3000

To others networked to your machine, the app should be found at:

http://{your IP address}:3000

Thank you for your time.
